## Welcome to Android-Common

This is a basic library to help build MVP-Architected Android application. Not only a basic architecture 
was provided in this repo, much more like: Compontented-Module-Build-Plugin, Router, releated annotation processor will be provided.

By the way, **the  Compontented-Module-Build-Plugin comes from [luojilab/DDComponentForAndroid](https://github.com/luojilab/DDComponentForAndroid)**, I am one contributor of this repo putting efforts to the router part. **Because some classes has changed it's name and path, so we need to rebuild the plugin**.


##Projects in this repo

* **componented-builder** a gradle plugin used to compile componented-module
* **basic-clean-architecture**
define basic class and interface referring the roles in clean architecture
* **component-anno-processor** process annotation for route, autowired and so on
